Work of Luke Franceschini and Nathaniel Woodger, May 2013.

This code was created as a culminating project proposal for a grade twelve
computer science class. The idea was that the maze would be generated by 
the included code, and the students would be required to write a program
that could solve the maze, with each program only being told information 
about immediately adjacent tiles.

Please note that this code does not necessarily work well or at all. Use 
at own risk. Development dropped drastically after it was decided that 
this code would not be used in the class culminating due to fears that 
the class would search for maze solving algorithms online because it is a 
common topic in computer science studies.

Note also that although the repository was created in May 2014, the only 
modification since May 2013 when the code was stored in local copies was
too remove the names of other students in the class who were not involved 
in the development of this program.

Development Tasks:
Luke Franceschini:
-Graphical display of maze and scoreboard
-Player super class
-Game loop

Nathan Woodger:
-Maze generation
-Sample maze solver
-Treasure
